I began developing a rigid body model for a two-dimensional drone that operates in the z-y plane. I have defined the system's states, along with its inputs and outputs. The next step is to linearize the system and design either a PID or a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller to determine a gain matrix that keeps the drone at the origin. When subjected to a constant external force, the drone should respond by increasing thrust and adjusting its tilt to maintain its position in the plane.

For the week of October 28 to November 1, my goal is to write code that implements this system, begin drafting the project outline, and start assembling a presentation.
